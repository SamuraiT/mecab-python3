ignore = E226,E221,E251,W503
# E226 ignored because sometimes var+"suffix" is easier to read than
# var + "suffix", depending on context.  (I wish it was possible to
# specify particular operators for which to ignore this warning.)
#
# E221/E251 (spacing around =) ignored because I believe in aligning
# equals signs on consecutive lines, and in putting spaces around the
# equals sign in a keyword argument whenever that makes it easier to read.
#
# W503 (line break before binary operator) ignored because it's mutually
# exclusive with W504 (line break *after* binary operator) -- you have to
# pick one or the other.
